                <p>I often get asked if wix.com or squarespace suffice - I realize I have a bit of conflict of interest here...</p>
                 <p>Those are fine if your site will be very simple, but I have heard many people get frustrated with the lack on
                     customizations. If you allow me to help you with your website, you can have the best of both worlds! I do have
                     experience maintaining and adding to Wordpress sites, but I will not do new ones that are anything other than
                     blogs or simple websites.</p>
